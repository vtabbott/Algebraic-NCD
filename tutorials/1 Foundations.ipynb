    "### Foundations of Neural Circuit Diagram Algebraic Operations\n",
    "*Neural Circuit Diagrams* are constructed from terms called ``Shape``s which represent either data types such as $\\mathbb{R}^{a \\times c} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{x}$ or operations such as $f: \\mathbb{R}^{a \\times b} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{c}$. For each data type $a$, there is an identity operation $a: a \\rightarrow a$. This means that data types can be uniquely identified by their identity operation."
